# Encoding
To reduce the search space, although hypotheses consists of local assumptiosn and local definitions, we do not show the differeneces in the predicates. For instance, we do not use hyp_predc(Id, Name, localassum, Idx), hyp_predc(Id, Name, localdef_term, Idx), or hyp_predc(Id, Name, localdef_type, Idx).

/ in tactic is replaced with $ by the naming convention of file.
